<div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-4">
	These symbols are commonly used in [Brand] user interface&rsquo;s. They are implemented as scalable vector graphics (SVG&rsquo;s) with png fallback&rsquo;s
	for older browsers. Using SVG&rsquo;s ensures the highest quality rendering on all devices, allows us to style the symbols using code and also complies
	with AA accessibility requirements.
