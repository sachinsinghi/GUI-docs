			&lsquo;It was much pleasanter at home,&rsquo; thought poor Alice, &lsquo;when one wasn&rsquo;t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered
			about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn&rsquo;t gone down that rabbit-hole — and yet — and yet — it&rsquo;s rather curious, you know, this
			sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here
			I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I&rsquo;ll write one.

			The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her
			arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with
			its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when
			she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act
			of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the
			doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very
			difficult game indeed.

			The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
			her in a languid, sleepy voice.<br>
			&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.<br>
			This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &lsquo;I — I hardly know, sir, just at present — at least I
			know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.&rsquo;<br>
			&lsquo;What do you mean by that?&rsquo; said the Caterpillar sternly. &lsquo;Explain yourself!&rsquo;<br>
			&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t explain myself, I&rsquo;m afraid, sir&rsquo; said Alice, &rsquo;because I&rsquo;m not myself, you see.&rsquo;<br>
			&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.<br>
			&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t put it more clearly,&rsquo; Alice replied very politely, &lsquo;for I can&rsquo;t understand it myself to begin
			with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.&rsquo;
