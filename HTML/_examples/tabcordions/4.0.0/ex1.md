	&lsquo;It was much pleasanter at home,&rsquo; thought poor Alice, &lsquo;when one wasn&rsquo;t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by
	mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn&rsquo;t gone down that rabbit-hole — and yet — and yet — it&rsquo;s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do
	wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!
	There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I&rsquo;ll write one.
