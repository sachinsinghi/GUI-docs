			We built a <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> app that runs on our server. This app is also open source and you can find it
			<a href="https://github.com/WestpacCXTeam/GUI-docs" target="_blank">here</a>. The repo also includes the GEL website which is built with
			<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, a ruby app that generates static files. And yes, we used the GUI to build the front-end.
