		<h2 class="body-font">What is the Blender?</h2>
		<p class="lead">
			The Blender is a tool that lets you mix the modules you need and leave out the ones you don&rsquo;t.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-2">
		<h3 class="body-font">Why do I have to choose my modules?</h3>
		<p class="content-text">
			Having the ability to choose which modules are relevant to your project means less overhead for your users, less stress for you when it comes to
			performance testing and fewer things that could go wrong. The fewer modules you choose, the smaller the footprint on your network, and the faster the
			experience for your users.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-2">
		<h3 class="body-font">What happens if I choose the wrong module(s) or if I've changed my mind?</h3>
		<p class="content-text">
			Don&rsquo;t worry, The Blender has got you covered. Each module you chose will be saved into the localStorage of your browser so that when you return the same
			selection will be waiting for you. However, because we know that you may want to change computers or might not have used the GUI site for a while, each download comes
			with a unique URL that saves all of your selected modules in their versions. Just have a look at the index page included in each download.<br>
			In the case that you delete this index page or don&rsquo;t have it handy, look in your CSS or JS file. Both have the URL hardcoded in the very top of the file
			inside a comment. Following this URL will bring you to The Blender with the very same selection of modules. You can then make adjustments and
			assess the impact on your project.
		</p>

	<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-2">
		<h3 class="body-font">What benefits do I get from using The Blender to choose my modules?</h3>
		<p class="content-text">
			Apart from the smaller footprint to your network, you will also be less affected by changes to modules that are not relevant to you. In the previous
			version of the GUI you had to install the newest version of the theme even if the changes didn't affect the modules that you had in use.<br>
			You now also have more control over what it is that you&rsquo;re downloading. You have options to include LESS or unminified JS and tap right into the guts
			of it all.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-2">
		<h3 class="body-font">What if I don&rsquo;t know which modules to choose?</h3>
		<p class="content-text">
			That&rsquo;s OK, we all start from the beginning. Try to choose as few as possible to begin with, and grow your Blend over time. We often feel like choosing everything with the intention of removing unncessary modules later on. However, this puts us at risk of forgetting to delete such modules, forcing the user to download more than what they need.
		<br>
			Have a look at the example pages and decide with your Designer, UXer and Developer on what you are likely to need for your project and go from there.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-2">
		<h3 class="body-font">What&rsquo;s in the download?</h3>
		<p class="content-text">
			The zip file that you download contains, at a minimum, the production ready asset files and an index.html page with all modules installed
			and explained. You can choose whether you want to include LESS and/or unminified JS files. This can be handy if you want to extend on the GUI.<br>
			<em>Remember to stay upgradable, as we may fix certain bugs which are relevant to your project. This will ensure that you don't double up on fixes. Additionally, make sure to always use and extend files rather than directly edit.</em>
