{% comment %} DESCRIPTION {% endcomment %}
{% capture description %}
	Use accordion elements to vertically stack related content. Each item can be expanded to reveal the content associated with that item. There can be zero
	expanded items, exactly one, or more than one items expanded at a time, depending on the configuration.
	Soft styling reduces emphasis.
